Accommodating involves giving in to your partner's wishes, fostering harmony but potentially neglecting your own needs. Competing is standing your ground firmly, which can be effective in urgent situations but may create tension if used frequently. Compromising seeks a middle ground where both partners make concessions, which works well for moderate conflicts.

Discuss how empathy differs from sympathy, which is feeling sorry for someone without fully understanding their emotions. For example, instead of saying, 'I'm sorry you're upset,' an empathetic response would be, 'I can see why you're upset, and I'm here to support you.' Sharing your definitions helps ensure you both have a common understanding of empathy and its role in your relationship."

For example, if arguing about household chores, one might write, 'I feel stressed when the chores pile up because it affects my relaxation time.'

Use statements like, 'I understand how that made you feel,' or 'It sounds like you're really excited about this.' Avoid jumping to solutions or minimizing their feelings. For instance, if your partner says they had a bad day, instead of saying, 'At least it's not raining,' respond with, 'I'm sorry you had a tough day. Do you want to talk about it?'
