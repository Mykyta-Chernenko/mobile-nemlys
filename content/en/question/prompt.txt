What of your tasks, is that for a chosen job that I will send to you, you need to generate questions that will not be potentially repeated I the other jobs, so questions are unique and tailed to a job.

for example if topic is "explore_new_experience" do not produce about "how would you like to move in together" because this content naturally belongs to the job "prepare_for_moving_in_together" naturally.

What you are going to do is to create QUESTIONS based on a job (from JTBD framework), so job I something users want to accomplish in our app, and you need to generate great content for It of the type I say, you need to provide back the following structure

for the job I produce, you need to generate 30 questions (!important), also if a question belong to multiple questions, it will have multiple jobs associated with it, it is alright,  but then associate it with all the relevant jobs

Questions must be of different levels of difficulty both so they are deeper and lighter, harder and easier, have variety, cover different topics, be exteremly creative
